# Kerbal Transfer & Flyby Illustrators

Online tools for calculating, optimizing, and visualizing interplanetary transfers and multi-flyby trajectories for Kerbal Space Program.

This project is a work in progress. Planned features include:
- support for modded solar systems (not just RSS and OPM)
- downloadable html files for interactive orbit plots
- additional plotting options (e.g. displaying maneuvers, apses, etc)
